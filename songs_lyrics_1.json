cantina\nMusic would play and Felina would whirl\n\nBlacker than night were the eyes of Felina\nWicked and evil while casting a spell\nMy love was deep for this Mexican maiden\nI was in love, but in vain, I could tell\n\nOne night a wild young cowboy came in\nWild as the West Texas wind\nDashing and daring, a drink he was sharing\nWith wicked Felina, the girl that I loved\n\nSo in anger I challenged his right\nFor the love of this maiden\nDown went his hand for the gun that he wore\nMy challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat\nThe handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor\n\nJust for a moment I stood there in silence\nShocked by the foul evil deed I had done\nMany thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there\nI had but one chance and that was to run\n\nOut through the back door of Rosa's I ran\nOut where the horses were tied\nI caught a good one, it looked like it could run\nUp on its back, and away I did ride\n\nJust as fast as I could from\nThe West Texas town of El Paso\nOut to the badlands of New Mexico\n\nBack in El Paso my life would be worthless\nEverything's gone in life, nothing is left\nIt's been so long since I've seen the young maiden\nMy love is stronger than my fear of death\n\nI saddled up and away I did go\nRiding alone in the dark\nMaybe tomorrow a bullet may find me\nTonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart\n\nAnd at last here I\nAm on the hill overlooking El Paso\nI can see Rosa's cantina below\nMy love is strong and it pushes me onward\nDown off the hill to Felina I go\n\nOff to my right I see five mounted cowboys\nOff to my left ride a dozen or more\nShouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me\nI have to make it to Rosa's back door\n\nSomething is dreadfully wrong for I feel\nA deep burning pain in my side\nThough I am trying to stay in the saddle\nI'm getting weary, unable to ride\n\nBut my love for Felina is strong\nAnd I rise where I've fallen\nThough I am weary I can't stop to rest\nI see the white puff of smoke from the rifle\nI feel the bullet go deep in my chest\n\nFrom out of nowhere Felina has found me\nKissing my cheek as she kneels by my side\nCradled by two loving arms that I'll die for\nOne little kiss, and Felina, goodbye\n\nSongwriter:  Marty Robbins"}, {"artist": "The Hollywood Argyles", "title": "Alley Oop", "year": 1960, "genre": "rock",

He was tall and lean, and at first you'd a-thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong, but one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong.

He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king. Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing:\n\n[Chorus:]\nI gotta walk that lonesome valley. I got to walk it by myself. Oh nobody else can walk it for me. I got to walk it by myself\n\n[2nd & 3rd times:]\nYou got to walk that lonesome valley. You got to walk it by yourself. Oh nobody else can walk it for you. You got to walk it by yourself\nIf ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray. Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor! Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face! He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black. He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's been many years since we had to part and I guess I learned his ways by heart. I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing. I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory 'cause I want you to understand.

you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction\n\nYeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'\nI'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'\nI can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation\nHandful of Senators don't pass legislation,\nAnd marches alone can't bring integration\nWhen human respect is disintegratin'\nThis whole crazy world is just too frustratin'\nAnd you tell me over and over and over again my friend\nAh, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction\n\nThink of all the hate there is in Red China\nThen take a look around to Selma, Alabama!\nAh, you may leave here, for four days in space\nBut when you return, it's the same old place\nThe poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace\nYou can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace\nHate your next-door-neighbour, but don't forget to say grace\nAnd you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend\nYou don't believe we're on the eve of destruction\nNo no you don't believe we're on the eve of

Joe\nAnd brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo\nThere was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring\nAnd now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of

down\n\nBonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation\nAnd made the graduation\nInto the banking business\nReach for the sky!\nSweet talking Clyde would holler\nAs Bonnie loaded dollars\nIn the dewlap bag\n\nNow one brave man\nHe tried to take them alone\nThey left him lying in a pool of blood\nAnd laughed about it all the way home\n\nBonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one\nRunning and hiding from every American lawman's gun\n\nThey used to laugh about dying\nBut deep inside them they knew\nThat pretty soon they'd be lying\nBeneath the ground together\nPushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew\n\nActing upon reliable information\nA Federal Deputation laid a deadly ambush\nWhen Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine\nA half a dozen carbines opened up on them\n\nBonnie and Clyde\nThey lived a lot together\nAnd finally together\nThey died"}, {"artist": "Mary Hopkin", "title": "Those Were the Days", "year": 1968, "genre": "folk", "genius_artist": "Mary

had kicked him down to the ground\nWhen he tried to get up life would kick him back down\nOne day papa called me to his dyin' bed\nPut his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said\nHe said:\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nTo pull the family through\nMy son, it's all left up to you\"\n\nTwo days later papa passed away\nAnd I became a man that day\nSo I told mama I was gonna

leave, just run away from home\n\nBut I would remember what my daddy said\nWith tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed\nHe said:\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nI've tried to do my best\nIt's up to you to do the rest\"\n\nThen one day a strong rain came\nAnd washed all the crops away\nAnd at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying\nThe weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nAnd you know, mama knew what I was going through\n\n'Cause every day I had to work the fields\n'Cause that's the only way we got our meals\nSee, I was the oldest of the family\nAnd everybody else depended on me\n\nEvery night I heard my mama pray:\n\"Lord, give him strength to make another day\"\n\nThough years have passed and all the kids have grown\nThe angels took mama to a brand new home\nLord knows, people, I shedded tears\nBut my daddy's voice helped me through the years\nSayin':\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nTo pull the family through\nMy son, it's all left up to you\"\n\nOh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nI've tried to do my best\nIt's up to you to do the rest\"\n\nI could still hear papa when he's saying:\n\n\"Patches, I'm

watched him on the stage\nMy hands were clenched in fists of rage\nNo angel born in hell\nCould break that Satan\u2019s spell\nAnd as the flames climbed high into the night\nTo light the sacrificial

she just smiled and turned away\nI went down to the sacred store\nWhere I\u2019d heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn\u2019t play\nAnd in the streets: the children screamed\nThe lovers cried, and the poets dreamed\nBut not a word was spoken;\nThe church bells all were broken\nAnd the three men I admire most:\nThe father, son, and the holy ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\nAnd they were singing\n\n[Deleted Verse]\nAnd there I stood alone and afraid\nI dropped to my knees and there I prayed\nAnd I promised him everything I could give\nIf only he would make the music live\nAnd he promised it would live once more\nBut this time one would equal four\nAnd in five years four had come to mourn\nAnd the music was reborn\n\n[Chorus]\nBye-bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye\nSinging, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I

you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nYeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea\"\n\nBrandy wears a braided chain\nMade of finest silver from the north of Spain\nA locket that bears the name\nOf a man that Brandy loved\n\nHe came on a summer's day\nBringing gifts from far away\nBut he made it clear he couldn't stay\nNo harbor was his home\n\nThe sailor said, \"Brandy, you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nBut my life, my love and my lady is the sea\"\n\nYeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes\nWhen he told his sailor's story\nShe could feel the ocean fall and rise\nShe saw its raging glory\nBut he had always told the truth\nLord, he was an honest man\nAnd Brandy does her best to understand\n\nAt night when the bars close down\nBrandy walks through a silent town\nAnd loves a man who's not around\nShe still can hear him say\n\nShe hears him say, \"Brandy, you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nBut my life, my love and my lady is the sea\nIt is, yes, it is\"\n\n\"Brandy, you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine

Box Dancer, what does it prove\nOnly that you need to see a statue that moves\nA tutu of satin, bordered with lace\nSlender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face\nHer beauty is balanced, an immovable pose\nEternally destined to remain on her toes\n\nMusic Box Dancer, she is only a toy\nProject upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy\nShe's perched on her stand, and never will part\nA final gaze upon her, now the music will start\n\nYou wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because\nYou've been here before, so give one final pause\nTo dream of the future, to reflect on the past\nMusic Box Dancer start your whirling at last\n\nThe room fills with music, such a cute song\nWatching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs\nBring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow\nWhenever wound up, she'll put on a good show\n\nMusic Box Dancer, do you think or believe\nShe could step off her box if she wanted to leave\nSo easy it is, twirl around with such grace\nStaying in her circle, she remains in one place\n\nSuch a brief moment, a small time to spend\nThe dancing will slow soon, the music will end\nIn real life we're plastic, nature's unfair\nHow can we breathe life, how can we share\nThe knowledge and insights hidden in tombs\nWe're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms\nWe sit on our shelves where objects reside\nWe don't allow the music to get right inside\n\nMusic Box Dancer's now completely alone\nNo winder or no listener, because nobody's home\nHow long before someone will re-wind the spring?\nThe room will now be witness; and silence can't sing"}, {"artist":

proves that I'm insane\n\n[Chorus]\nYou may be right\nI may be crazy\nBut it just may be a lunatic you're looking for\nTurn out the light\nDon't try to save me\nYou may be wrong for all I know\nBut you may be right\n\nRemember how I found you there\nAlone in your electric chair\nI told you dirty jokes until you smiled\nYou were lonely for a man\nI said take me as I am\nBeause you might enjoy some madness for a while\nNow think of all the years you tried to\nFind someone to satisfy you\nI might be as crazy as you say\nIf I'm crazy then it's true\nThat it's all because of you\nAnd you wouldn't want me any other way\n\n[Chorus][Repeat 2x]"}, {"artist": "Charlie Dore", "title": "Pilot of the Airwaves", "year": 1980, "genre": "pop", "genius_artist": "Charlie Dore", "genius_title":

alright\nNight time is the right time, we make love\nThen it's his and my time, we take off\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\nHe takes me to a movie or to a restaurant\nTo go slow dancing, anything I want\nOnly when he's with me, I catch light\nOnly when he gives me, makes me feel alright\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\nAll day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly\nI'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)\nWhen he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight\nWork all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\n(My baby takes the morning train)\nHe's always on that morning train\n(He works from nine to five and then)\nHe works so hard\n(He takes another home again)\nTo find me
