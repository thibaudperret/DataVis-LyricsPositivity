searching for a real love\nI\u2019m out to have a real love\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I met you I just knew that you would take my heart and run\nUntil you told me how you loved for me, you said I\u2019m not the one\nSo I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of\nAnd now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love\n\n[Chorus]\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nI\u2019m out to have a real love\n\n[Bridge]\nLove so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true\nI thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind\nBut it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong maybe I\u2019ll find a\nReal love\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I\u2019ve tried my best and prayed to God He\u2019ll send me someone real\nTo caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel\nNow I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all\nIll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall\n\n[Chorus]\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nI\u2019m out to have a real love\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nI\u2019m out to have a real love\n\n[Outro](Chorus)\nSee I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go\nBeen around the world and high and low and still I never know\nHow it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around\nGotta end it in this way cause it seems he can't be found\n\n[Chorus]\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nI\u2019m out to have a real love\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nI\u2019m out to have a real love"}, {"artist": "The KLF", "title": "Justified and

big, bad, wolfff\n\nWell the first little piggy, well he was kinda hip\nHe spent most of his days, just a dreamin of the city\nAnd then one day, he bought a guitar\nHe moved to Hollywood, to become a star\nBut, living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city\nBuilt his house out of straw, what a pity\nAnd then one day, jammin on some chords\nAlong came the wolf, knocking on his door\n\n[Chorus:]\nLittle Pig, Little Pig, let me in\nNot by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!\nLittle Pig, Little Pig, let me in\nNot by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!\nWell I'm huffin, I'm puffin, I'll blow your house in\nHuffin, puffin, blow your house in\nHuffin, puffin, blow your house in\nHuffin and a puffin and I'll blow your house in!!!\n\nWell the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoked\nHe spent most of his time just a ganga smokin\nHuffin and a puffin down on Venice Beach\nGetting paid money for religious speech\nHe built his shelter from what he garbage picked\nMostly made up of old cans and sticks\nThen one day he was cranking out Bob Marley\nAnd along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley\n\n[Chorus:]\nWell the third little piggy, the grade A student\nHis daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent\nEarned his Masters Degree, from Harvard College\nBuilt his house from his architect knowledge\nA tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills\nDaddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills\nAnd then one day came the old house smasher\nThe big bad wolf the little piggy slasher\n\n[Chorus:]\nWell the big bad Wolf\nWell he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could\nAnd low and behold the little piggy's house stood\n\"IT'S MADE OUT OF CONCRETE!\" the little piggy shouted\nThe wolf just frowned, as he pouted\nSo they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would\nThe sent out rambo, just as fast, as they could\n\n(Rambo)\n\"YO, WOLF-FACE, I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE, YOUR ASS IS MINE!!!\"\n\n(gunshots)\n\nWell the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see\nSo that's to end the story, for you and me\nIf you still give a listen, you just may, here a big wolf or little piggy\nSay\n\n(Chorus [a little different])\n\" And the moral of the story is, ' A band with no talent can easily amuse\nIdiots, with a stupid, puppet show. \""}, {"artist": "Aerosmith", "title": "Livin' on the Edge", "year": 1993, "genre": "metal", "genius_artist": "Aerosmith", "genius_title": "Livin' On The

help\nBut Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else\nOne of them dames was sexy as hell\nI said \"Ooh, I like your size!\"\nShe said \"My car's broke down\nAnd you seem real nice, would you let me ride?\"\nI got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell\nThe next stop is the Eastside Motel\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Warren G]\nI'm tweakin' into a whole new era\nG-funk, step

is rhythm\n\n[Nate Dogg]\nIf you know like I know\nYou don't wanna step to this\nIt's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist\nIf you smoke like I smoke\nThen you're high like everyday\nAnd if

the ghetto didn't seem so tough\nAnd though we had it rough, we always had enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with a local crew and had a smoke or two\nAnd I realize Mama really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life to raise me right\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen\nI'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay the rent\nAnd in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen\nI try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind\nLast night my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity\nIt seems the rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up\nYou know, it's funny, when it rains it pours\nThey got money for wars but can't feed the poor\nSay there ain't no hope for the youth\nAnd the truth is it ain't no hope for the future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy\nI blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby\nWe ain't meant to survive, \u2018cause it's a set-up\nAnd even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up\n\n[Hook]\nKeep

around)\nWatching you, watching me, one lonely star\n(One lonely star you don't know who you are)\n\n[Chorus]\nI've always been in love with you (always with you)\nI guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)\nYou took my love for granted, why oh why\nThe show is over, say good-bye\nSay good-bye (bye bye), say good-bye\n\n[Verse 2]\nMake them laugh, it comes so easy\nWhen you get to the part\nWhere you're breaking my heart (breaking my heart)\nHide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown\n(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)\nWish you well, I cannot stay\nYou deserve an award for the role that you played (role that you played)\nNo more masquerade, you're one lonely star\n(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)\n\n[Chorus]\nI've always been in love with you (always with you)\nI guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)\nYou took my love for granted, why oh why\nThe show is over, say good-bye\nSay good-bye (bye bye), say good-bye\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll the world is a stage (world is a stage)\nAnd everyone has their part (has their part)\nBut how was I to know which way the story\u2019s go\nHow was I to know you'd break\n(You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)\nYou'd break my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nI've always been in love with you (always with you)\nI guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)\nYou

wind?\n\n[Bridge]\nHow high does the sycamore grow?\nIf you cut it down\nThen you'll never know\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon\nFor whether we are white or

ugly to me\nAnd I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life\nWe are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday\nIn a bar that faces a giant car wash\nThe good people of the world are washing their cars\nOn their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing\nAs best they can in skirts in suits\nThey drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks\nBack to the phone company, the record store too\nWell, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling I'm not the only one\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling I'm not the only one\nAll I wanna do is

on the bar\nThen he lights every match in an oversized pack\nLetting each one burn down to his thick fingers\nBefore blowing and cursing them out\nAnd he's watching the bottles of Bud\nAs they spin on the floor\nAnd a happy couple enters the bar\nDangerously close to one another\nThe bartender looks up from his want ads, but\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling I'm not the only one\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling I'm not the only one\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nUntil the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard\n\n[Bridge]\nOtherwise the bar is ours\nThe day and the night and the car wash too\nThe matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty\nCars\nThe sun and the moon but\n\n[Chorus Variation]\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling I'm not the only one\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling I'm not the only one\nAll I wanna do is have some fun\nI got a feeling the party's just begun\nAll I wanna do is have

rain\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the rain\n\n[Verse 2]\nCould you be dead?\nYou always were two steps ahead\nOf everyone\nWe'd walk behind while you would run\nI look up at your house\nAnd I can almost hear you shout\nDown to me\nWhere I always used to be\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the rain\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the rain\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack on the train\nI ask why did I come again\nCan I confess\nI've been hanging around your old address?\nAnd the years have proved\nTo offer nothing since you moved\nYou're long gone\nBut I can't move on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the rain\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the rain\n\n[Verse 4]\nI step off the train\nI'm walking down your street again\nAnd past your

you\nYou've found some better place\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the rain\nAnd I miss you, yeah\nLike the deserts miss the rain\nAnd I miss you\nLike the deserts miss the
