what's up with L-o-c?\nThe girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar\nHavin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star\nSo I got up and strolled over to the other side of

glass, and the girls'll come real quick\nIt's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac\nA couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap\nSo I gave some to my dog when he began to beg\nThen he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg\nHe used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner\nBut now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina\n\nYou know what I'm sayin?\nI got every dog in my neighborhood breakin down my door\nI got Spuds McKenzie\nAlex from Stroh's\nThey won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal\n\n[Verse

it\"\nThen a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it\nSo I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned\nBut when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man\nSo I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener\nYou must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina\n\nYou know, ain't no plans with a man\nThis is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?\n\nBreak it down\n\n[Verse 4]\nBack in the saddle, lookin for a little affection\nI took a shot as a contestant on \"The Love Connection\"\nThe audience voted, and you know they picked a winner\nI took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner\nShe had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin\nInstead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding\nI said, \"Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya\"\nThat's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina\n\nYa know what I'm sayin\nThat

didn't ask him his name\nThis lonely boy in the rain\nFate, tell me it's right\nIs this love at first sight?\nPlease don't make it wrong\nJust stay for a night\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nSay you will, you want me too\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI got loving arms to hold onto\n\nSo we found this hotel\nIt was a place I knew well\nWe made magic that night\nOh, he did everything right\n\nHe brought the woman out of me\nSo many times, easily\nAnd in the morning, when he woke\nAll I left him was a note\n\nI told him I am the flower\nYou are the seed\nWe walked in the garden\nWe planted a tree\n\nDon't try to find me\nPlease don't you dare\nJust live in my memory\nYou'll always be there\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI got loving arms to hold onto\n\nWhoa, oh, we made love\nLove like strangers\nAll night long\nWe made love\n\nThen it happened one day\nWe came 'round the same way\nYou can imagine his surprise\nWhen he saw his own eyes\n\nI said, \"Please, please understand\nI'm in love with another man\nAnd what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa\nWas the one little thing that you can\"\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nCome on, say you will, you want me too\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne

in your Jeep or your Benzos\nOr in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos\nBack in Philly we be out in the park\nA place called the Plateau is where everybody goes\nGuys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise\nHonkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes\nShe turn around to see what you beepin' at\nIt's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac\nAnd with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme\nTo hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime\n\n[Hook]\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet\nHustle to the mall to get me a short set\nYeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair\nCause basketball courts in the summer got girls there\nThe temperature's about 88\nHop in the water plug just for old times sake\nBreak to ya crib change your clothes once more\nCause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4\nSittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce\nAbout the days growin' up and the first person you kiss\nAnd as I think back makes me wonder how\nThe smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia\nAll the kids playin' out front\nLittle boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch\nWhile the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion\nThen six o'clock rolls around\nYou just finished wipin' your car down\nIt's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout\nIt looks like a car show\nEverybody come lookin' real fine\nFresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon\nEvery moment frontin' and maxin'\nChillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'\nLeanin' to the side but you can't speed through\nTwo miles an hour so everybody sees you\nThere's an air of love and of happiness\nAnd this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness\n\n[Hook] repeated till it fade out\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind"}, {"artist": "Scorpions", "title": "Wind of Change", "year": 1991, "genre":

surrender act tender be gentle and kind\nYou always know what to say and do\nCold flip when you think your man is playing you\nNot cheap or petty, you're ready for loving\nYou're real independent so your parents be bugging\nBut if you ever need a place to stay\nCome around my way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me

thirsty\nThe Lord allowed me to drink some more\nHe said what I am searching for are\nThe answers to all which are in front of me\nThe ultimate truth started to get blurry\nFor some strange reason it
